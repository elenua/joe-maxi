		        	<h1>About</h1>
		        	<p class="goal">Technology has changed the way people order taxis.<br><br>It may have suited drivers for passengers  to flag you down as your driving along. Those customers are now gone, They order first, and walk out later, once they know their taxi on their driveway. Now thats customer service, and we can do it for them.  We even do not charge the 2 euro booking fee to do it.<br></br>
					Of course being sure of where a fare is, also reduces your fuel cost. That part is the benefit.</p>

					<h1>Changes</h1>
					<p class="goal">High Standards must remain !!!!<br><br>

					However, no more informing customers they can waste 5 minutes of your time for free.  METERS START ON ARRIVAL.<br><br>

					12% commission gone !!! No more inputting total fares, Just press FREE at the end of the journey to get your next job.  We will charge ourselves 50 cent per job., to cover operating costs of the app. We will decrease the price, if the bank balance is building,<br><br>

					Example . . . . . 
					Meter says 20 euro, we currently get €17.60 of that. With our own app, we will get €19.50.<br><br>

					€2.50 Cancellation fee charged to customers cancelling the taxi after 5 minutes of booking.<br><br>

					Rating customers as good, normal or difficult. Customers who repeatably get bad reviews by drivers will be cut off from the system for a number of weeks.<br><br>

					€1 booking fee to be introduced by next year. ( to be voted on )<br><br>

					No more wasting time driving to PreBooks, our app will despatch pre-booked jobs 6 minutes before they are due. We can show where areas where pre-books are coming up. We only take pre-bookings in the general Dublin area, where we know we can guarantee taxi service. We will not take pre bookings from Harcourt St Sat night (really Sunday morning) at 3.30am where is it is impossible to meet the passenger. </p>

					<p class="goal">Join up, so you can be kept up to date !</p>
					<p class="goal">The technology required to provide this app, is being supplied at no upfront cost to the taxi drivers of Ireland. The developer will retain ownership of the technology for use in regions outside of Ireland.
